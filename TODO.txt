- modify the object class to have radii
rename it to particle
- remove the acceleration
- delete leapfrog, total force and grav force functions
- modify simpleUpdate to not care about acceleration
- add function to see if two particles in the same place
- modify the particle class to use inverse mass instead of mass
- write collide() function
- write in the walls
check wall collision
perform wall collisions
- move the walls in simpleUpdate()
- output the walls
- modify file reading to read radii
- as well and calculate inverse mass
- read in the walls

make the plot not plot trajectories
except maybe of one particle
plot and animate the walls
